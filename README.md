# CYu_L1MIPI_CS_Project
Project I made for the CS demo on my freshman year at CYu on December 2019.  
See projet.pdf (written in French) for the subject.

# Running the project
The project runs on Windows 10 and should work on any GNU/Linux distributions as long the console supports UTF-8 encoding and emojis.  
CY Cergy Paris UniversitÃ© computers run on Ubuntu LTS and students use GCC as C compiler.  
  
If you are using Ubuntu LTS then open a terminal and do:
> gcc projet.c -o projet  
> ./projet  

If you want to use the English edition then do:  
> gcc english_edition/project.c -o project  
> ./project
